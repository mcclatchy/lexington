Opening Drive
===

This video project follows the first Frederick Douglass Broncos high school
football team. 

Code in the /src/ folder generates the iframe code for the article. I am using a
small program called [loopit](https://github.com/pilgreen/loopit) to build the
pages. Binary files for linux and OSX are in the releases.
